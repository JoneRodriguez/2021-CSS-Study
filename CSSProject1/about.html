                        herself in a world with beauty standards, high expectations of her, while struggling with mental illness.</td>

                    <td>K-12 is a surreal dark comedy musical which follows Cry Baby as she enters, as she puts it, “the worst years of [her] life.”
                        Faced with bullies, cruel teachers and patriarchal mind control, Cry Baby fights the system with her good friends and an angelic spirit guide by her side.
                        The lyrics are not subtle in their storytelling. Despite the lyrics being on-the-nose, Melanie has no qualms tack-ling heavy subjects like sexual assault and eating disorders.
                        Some standouts on the album are “Wheels On The Bus,” “The Principal,” “Nurse’s Office,” and “Orange Juice.”</td>
